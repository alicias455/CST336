        Hello! <br />

        <p>
            There are many types of viruses that have developed as technology has developed. The one recognized as the
            first was called Creeper. Written by Bob Thomas in 1971, it spread through DEC PDP-10 computers on ARPAnet
            and would display the message "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" Yet, the first virus detected in the wild
            was written in 1982 by a 15-year-old in Pittsburgh, Rich Skrenta. It was a boot sector virus called Elk
            Cloner designed to infect Apply II computers. However, the first PC virus to be found in the wild was Brain,
            it was created in Pakistan in 1986.
        </p>


        <p>Given some history about how viruses began, this site provides information on three specific types:</p>

        <p><mark>Resident Virus:</mark> <br />
            is a virus that will <ins>install</ins> itself on a computer allowing it to spread even <br />
            when the original "infected" file has been removed.
        </p>

        <p><mark>Direct Action Virus:</mark> <br />
            is a virus that will attached itself to a <ins>specific type of file</ins>. When the <br />
            file is used, it comes to life and begins searching for similar files to spread to.
        </p>

        <p><mark>Boot Sector Virus:</mark> <br />
            is a virus that infects the <ins>master boot record</ins>. It usually spreads by removable media like USB drives <br />
            and email attachments.
        </p>
