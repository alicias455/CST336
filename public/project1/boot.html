            Boot sector viruses can be some of the most dangerous for a everyday user. They are hard to remove and <br />
            usually require a full system format. A full system will scrub through the hard drive from scratch and <br />
            rebuild all of its file structures. This is the case if the virus has indeed encrypted the boot <br />
            sector or inordinately damaged the code. In other instances, when hard to notice the virus, a simple <br />
            run of an updated antivirus program with a large registry of boot viruses can safely remove the virus. <br />
            The boot sector virus was very popular in the 1990's when floppy disks were in high demand. Fortunately, <br />
            their frequency has greatly reduce from improvements in BIOS architecture.
