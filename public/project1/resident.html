            The resident virus is one primary type of file infector. As mentioned on the home page, it installs <br />
            itself on a computer and is sometimes very difficult to remove. This virus can be hard to spot, thus  <br />
            making it harder to remove. The slow infector, one area of the resident virus, is an example of when <br />
            the virus could be difficult to notice as the symptoms develop slowly. However, the second area, the <br />
